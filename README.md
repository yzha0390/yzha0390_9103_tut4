**Imaging Technique Inspiration
I came across some incredibly useful code in the p5.js library that showcases snowfall and snow accumulation. I would like to integrate certain features, such as controlling randomness with 'noiseScale', incorporating physical elements like 'wind' to simulate natural effects, and randomizing object display based on mouse position within 'draw()'. Additionally, I plan on utilizing 'xSet' to accumulate particle positions for an even greater accumulation effect. I believe that including physical elements will enhance my future code, and I anticipate creating fun interactions through mouse clicks and movements.
